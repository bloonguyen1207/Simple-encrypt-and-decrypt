STRETCHING BETWEEN LONDON AND FRANKFURT, THERE IS A PRIVATE, MYSTERIOUS NETWORK THAT IS TWICE AS FAST AS THE NORMAL INTERNET. THE CONNECTION, PROVIDED BY A SERIES OF MICROWAVE DISHES ON MASTS, WAS ONCE COMPLETELY SECRET: ONLY ONE VERY RICH COMPANY WAS ALLOWED TO USE IT, AND NO ONE ELSE KNEW ABOUT IT.

A COUPLE OF YEARS LATER THOUGH, A COMPETITOR COMPLETED ITS OWN MICROWAVE LINK BETWEEN THE TWO CITIES--AND THUS THE FIRST COMPANY, NOT WANTING TO LOSE OUT ON POTENTIAL BUSINESS, REVEALED THAT IT TOO HAD A LINK BETWEEN THE CITIES. IF A COMPETITOR HAD NEVER EMERGED, THAT FIRST LINK WOULD PROBABLY STILL BE SHROUDED IN SECRECY TODAY.
