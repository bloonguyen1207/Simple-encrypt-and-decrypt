FRESH OFF THE LAUNCH OF THE GOOGLE PIXEL, THE NEW GOOGLE HARDWARE DIVISION IS BACK WITH ITS SECOND PRODUCT: GOOGLE HOME, A VOICE COMMAND APPLIANCE AND GOOGLE CAST-ENABLED SPEAKER. THERE IS BASICALLY NO INTERFACE AT ALL TO THIS PRODUCT--IT'S ALL VOICE COMMANDS, ALL THE TIME. I HOPE YOU LIKE SPEAKING TO YOUR ELECTRONICS.
HERE AT ARS, WE'RE ALWAYS MAKING LISTS (JUST LIKE LIAM NEESON). LISTS OF SCIENCE FICTION MOVIES ARE A COMMON ITEM FOR DISCUSSION ON THE ARS STAFF SLACK CHANNE--PARTICULARLY SHORT LISTS OF THE BEST SCIENCE FICTION MOVIES EVER MADE. BUT "BEST" IS AN IMPOSSIBLE WORD TO QUANTIFY IN ANY BROADLY APPLICABLE WAY--ONE PERSON'S "BEST EVER" MIGHT BE ANOTHER PERSON'S WORST, ESPECIALLY IN A GENRE OF MOVIES AS RICH AND VARIED AS SCIENCE FICTION.

offset: 1

The message is encrypted by vernam (addition). Therefore, the decryption function will use subtraction.
We tried 4 different keys:
 + the 2 combinations of the plain text of message 1 + 2 / message 2 + 1
 + the 2 combinations of the cipher text of message 1 + 2 / message 2 + 1.
At first, we tried with offset 18 and 29 (which are the keys of message 1 and 2 respectively), but it did not work.
Then, we started trying different offset from 0, and it works with offset 1.
The key is the combination of the plain text of message 1 and 2.
